### Source Code

```
First on the list is mouse wheel scrolling in
the IDE. We know it should be an addin but
where is it located? I did a search and found
a MS KB article. After downloading both files,
I found the VB6 package to be lacking files
and the IntelliPoint package did not help my
particular mouse. I then went to the author's
blog and downloaded the update.
VB6 MouseWheelFix - Now works in SDI Mode!

Now when I open some code, I can scroll
using my mouse wheel.
----------------------------
The one everyone likes is MZTools for Visual
Basic 6.0 MZ-Tools 3.0 works on any 32-bit
or 64-bit Windows operating system, including
Windows Vista and Windows 7. MZ-Tools 3.0
is a freeware add-in for Visual Basic 6.0,
Visual Basic 5.0 and the Visual Basic For
Applications editor (provided by a VBA-enabled
application such as those in Office 2000-2010
32-bit, except Office 64-bit) which adds several
productivity features to the IDE. Download at:

I realize that this should be in the forum but felt
that there are many of you looking for a little
assistance and this just might do it.
Happy coding.
